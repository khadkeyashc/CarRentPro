# CarRentPro
CarRentPro is a Java-based commercial car rental system designed to connect individual vehicle owners with organizations seeking long-term vehicle rentals. The system enables customers to register their vehicles, which can then be leased to organizations under contract-based agreements ranging from 3 months to 5 years. Built using Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI) and MySQL for backend data management, CarRentPro provides a secure, scalable, and user-friendly platform that automates the rental lifecycleâ€”from user registration to vehicle tracking and reporting.
